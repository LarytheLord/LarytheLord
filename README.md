Hi there!  
Iâ€™m Abid, a full-stack web developer, open-source enthusiast, and hackathon explorer based in India.
I love building useful, impactful tools and turning wild ideas into polished digital experiences. From automating objections against factory farms to crafting a code-sharing social media platform, Iâ€™m always experimenting at the intersection of code and community.
Outside of tech, youâ€™ll find me waking up early to study, posting coding content on social media, or diving into a good anime. Iâ€™ve participated in hackathons like the one by Electric Sheep x Open Paws, and Iâ€™m building **Joy Hacks**, a code-reel platform to make learning and sharing code fun.
Fun Facts:  
- I started coding during JEE prep just to make things more exciting.  
- My laptop login screen says 4:30 AM for a reason ðŸ˜‰  
- I believe code can change mindsâ€”not just apps.
