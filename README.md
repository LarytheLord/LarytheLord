Hey , oh Hi there!🙋
I’m Abi, a full web & app dev, open-source bay, and hackathon explorer.
I hate building useless stuff.

Welcome to My Block (of code)

Outside of tech, you’ll find me waking up early to study, posting coding content on social media, or diving into a good Manhwa. 
Currently learning CS, breaking stuff, fixing it (sometimes), and shipping fast MVPs with just enough caffeine. I do tech-for-good, open-source, and anyone who says, “let’s build it and see what happens.”

Fun Facts:  
- My laptop login screen says 4:30 AM for a reason 😉  
- I believe code can change storage usage not apps.
