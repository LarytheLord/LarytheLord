Hey , oh Hi there!ðŸ™‹
Iâ€™m Abi, a full web dev, open-source enthusiast, and hackathon explorer.
I hate building useless stuff.

Outside of tech, youâ€™ll find me waking up early to study, posting coding content on social media, or diving into a good Manhwa. 
Iâ€™m building **Joy Hacks**, a code-reel platform to make learning and sharing code fun.

Fun Facts:  
- My laptop login screen says 4:30 AM for a reason ðŸ˜‰  
- I believe code can change storage usage not apps.
