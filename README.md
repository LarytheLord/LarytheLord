## ðŸš€ About Me
I build real stuff, not filler. I love shipping fast, MVP-styleâ€”just enough caffeine and hustle to get the job across the finish line.

Up before dawn sharpening skills

Dropping coding content on social media

## ðŸŽ¯ Fun Facts
My laptop login clock? 5:30â€¯AM â€” because why not catch the sunrise in code?
